0.What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
Ans:
An invented long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
Ans:
Get resource usage

2.Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
Ans:
16

3.Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate,
  even though we’re not changing their contents?
Ans:
We are going to delete memory allocation.

4.Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file.
  In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
Ans:
It uses fgetc to read through every single character in the words.
When the cursor reaches the end of the words, the number of length of the words is smaller than the number of the highest index.
In such a situation, the index returns to zero and then prepare a new word in the loop.
All these work until EOF.

5.Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time
  rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time?
  Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
Ans:
We must allocate memory in order to use fscanf, but using fgetc does not require to do so.
It makes it easier to get the job done because we have fewer things to worry about, like free the memory etc.

6.Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
Ans:
They are not to be changed in the program.
Declaring them as constant is a way to ensure they are not changed.
