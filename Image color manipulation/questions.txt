1.What’s stdint.h?
Ans:It is a library that allows programmers to declare integer types including the followings:
int8_t
int16_t
int32_t
uint8_t
uint16_t
uint32_t


2.What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans:First,what are they?
uint8_t is unsigned char
uint32_t is unsigned short
int32_t is unsigned integer
uint16_t is unsigned long long
The word "unsigned" means all values in the variable are non-negative.
In what situation, non-negative values are a must?


3.How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans:
BYTE (uint8_t / unsigned char)        --- 1 byte
DWORD (uint32_t / unsigned short)     --- 2 bytes
LONG (int32_t / unsigned integer)     --- 4 bytes
WORD (uint16_t / unsigned long long)  --- 8 bytes


4.What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
Ans: 0x42  &  0x4                       WORD   bfType


5.What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans: bfSize is the size of the whole BMP file.
     biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER file.  It is constant(= 40 bytes for a bitmap).


6.What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans:The image will be top-down.

7.What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Ans:(Probably)
    LONG biXPelsPerMeter;
    LONG biYPelsPerMeter;

8.Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
Ans:
There is nothing at the address. / It can't find the file.

9.Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans:Because we are iterating every single pixel


10.What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans:
3

11.What does fseek do?
Ans:fseek allows the program to move to a specific location.
In this task, it is to skip the padding.


12.What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans:Current position in file
